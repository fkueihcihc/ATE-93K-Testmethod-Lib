# ATE-93K-Testmethod-Lib
this lib is for free for ATE engineer, as i found  ATE engineer was a small group that nobody was found to share their technical on public
this will increase barriers to entry
I create this lib is that i hope more and more people can be very easy to enter the industry, to finish the chip test task without worrying about coding.
I hope it Can be borrowed as simple as python programming and hope more and more ATE engineer can join to share their testmethod
