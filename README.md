# ATE-93K-Testmethod-Lib make ATE easier
This lib is for free for ATE engineer, as i found  ATE engineer was a small group that nobody was found to share their testmethod on public
this will increase barriers to entry for new guys
I create this lib is for that i wish more and more people can be very easy to enter the industry, to finish the chip test task without worrying about coding.
I hope it Can be borrowed as simple as python programming and hope more and more ATE engineer can join us to share their testmethod
